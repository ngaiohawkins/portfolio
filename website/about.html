                    <p id="bio-desc">Hi! I’m Ngaio Hawkins. I’m a senior Computer Science major at Clarkson University. My coding expertise is in C++ and Java but I have worked with a myriad of other languages like C, JavaScript, Kotlin, CSS, HTML and more. I also have worked in web development, using platforms such as Squarespace and Weebly. This work enabled me to gain knowledge on how to work with clients and translate their needs/requirements into practical formats. I had an internship this summer with OpenIAM that helped me learn how to work within a team to develop identity and access management software. I created documentation on interacting with OpenIAM’s REST API using Java and learned about Postman/utilizing Maven libraries. Outside of computer science, I have been playing team sports my entire life (mainly soccer and basketball), play trumpet and enjoy watching films.</p>
